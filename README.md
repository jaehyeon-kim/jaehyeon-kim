ðŸ”­ I work as a data engineer focused on working with customers to design and build their data and analytics solutions on multiple cloud providers and data platforms. 

âš¡ Also, I am enthusiastic about data streaming and enjoy writing posts on *Data Engineering*, *Data Streaming*, *Analytics*, *Real-time Analytics*, and *Architecture*. See my posts on https://jaehyeon.me/. 

ðŸ’¡ I recently started an open source project called [Apache Beam Python I/O Connectors](https://github.com/beam-pyio), which aims to build [Apache BeamÂ®](https://beam.apache.org/) I/O Connectors using the Python SDK.
