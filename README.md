⚙️ I work as a data engineer focused on working with customers to design and build their data and analytics solutions on multiple cloud providers and data platforms. 

📝 I enjoy writing posts on *Data Engineering*, *Data Streaming*, *Analytics*, *Real-time Analytics*, and *Architecture*. See my posts on https://jaehyeon.me/. 

❤️ I am a maintainer of an open source project called [Apache Beam Python I/O Connectors](https://github.com/beam-pyio), which develops [Apache Beam®](https://beam.apache.org/) I/O Connectors using the Python SDK.
