I lead Developer Experience at Factor House, where I create technical content, drive platform engineering initiatives, and present at meetups and conferences. With expertise in real-time systems and modern data platforms, I've worked extensively with Kafka, Flink, Spark, and the integrated architectures. As a passionate engineer and writer, I share practical insights on real-time analytics, data architectures, data lakehouse patterns, data lineage, and building systems that remain resilient, observable, and maintainable at scale.
